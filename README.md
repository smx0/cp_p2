## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add. 
Had trouble with backend and routing. When doing the lab, `gift` and `gifts` look very similar, and are very easy to mix up. I suggest changing `gifts` to something like `all_gifts` or `allGifts`.
